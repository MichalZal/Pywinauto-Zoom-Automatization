# 16th May. 
### Trying to Add the function to work in background on windows. 
### It's not very optimised code but with time I will update it. 

# 8th June. 
### Added library pynput, which helps to work with inputs. Its adding the posbility to listen for inputs, when the program is minised. This helps a lot, because this script will work with arduino. Arduino will send the keystrokes when the foregin button is clicked, and it will triger the proper function to execute. 
### Also added the function, which close the sharing screen automatically.
